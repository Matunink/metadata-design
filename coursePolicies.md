#### Academic Honesty   
Students in this class are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty.   Cheating in any form is a serious matter and can affect your permanent record.  Plagiarism (using the words and/or ideas of another without attribution) is also cheating and is subject to the same penalties.  All work submitted for the class should be done by you unless otherwise specified.  Do your own work on assignments, and exams, and do not provide unauthorized assistance to others, and you will not only help uphold the ethical standards of the university community, you'll undoubtedly learn more. 

#### Attendance
You are expected to be present at all class sessions, and to be prepared to discuss assignments.  If you need to miss class for any reason, you should communicate with your instructor.  Please note that communicating wtih your instructor does not assure that absences are "excused." Since each class is one week of the semester, more than one absence is considered excessive.  Excessive absences will affect the class particpation component of the grade.

#### Special Accommodations
Students requesting accommodations for disabilities should be registered with Student Disability Services, 310 0 Burge Hall, (319) 335-1462. Staff will review the documentation to determine eligibility for accommodations. The SDS staff and student will discuss appropriate accommodations for each class and assist the student in communicating with the faculty about his or her accommodations.

#### Administrative Home
The Graduate College is the administrative home of this course and governs matters such as add/drop deadlines, grading guidelines, absences and other related matters. If you are unclear about the policies that govern you or this course, contact the Dean of the Graduate College

#### Electronic Communication 
University policy specifies that students are responsible for all official correspondences sent to their standard University of Iowa e-mail address (@uiowa.edu). Students should check this account frequently.

#### Concerns about Faculty Actions
Students who have a concern about a faculty action should first address the issue with the instructor, then the course supervisor (if there is one), and then the departmental DEO. If the student cannot resolve the issue at this level, the concern should be sent in writing to the Dean of University College.

#### Understanding Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being of students, faculty, and staff. All members of the UI community have a responsibility to uphold this mission and to contribute to a safe environment that enhances learning. Incidents of sexual harassment should be reported immediately. See the UI Comprehensive Guide on Sexual Harassment (Operations Manual [http://www.uiowa.edu/~our/opmanual/ii/04.htm](http://www.uiowa.edu/~our/opmanual/ii/04.htm)) for assistance, definitions, and the full University policy.

#### Reacting Safely to Severe Weather
In severe weather, class members should seek appropriate shelter immediately, leaving the classroom if necessary. The class will continue, if possible, when the event is over.
