The CNW put these up last summer and fall, one each at every crossing starting a[t] Dean Av (1st xing out of Short Line yd. D.M.) and working north along the old RI Spine Line. I have only went as far N as Cambridge, Ia, so I don't know just how far they continue. I would suspect all the way to Chgo Jct at Nevada, but I don't know. Another things they only read to S bound trains on the engineers side, or W side of tracks, until they get to about Hull Av where they are between the RI and old FTDDMS tracks. You will even note that the sign for Des Moines St. is spelled Des Moine I think due to the sign boards (which are steel) being pre cut to length before being lettered--Map verso."
