## Course project


#### 1. Project Scope, Audience, User tasks
_Draft due: 2/25_

(1 page max., single-spaced)

#### 2. Standards  
_Draft due: 3/4_  
List and briefly describe all standards and vocabularies you'll use in your project as well as a justification for each (i.e. how this standard supports the purposes of your project). This should include: structural standards/record formats, content standards, encoding standards, data serialization formats, and controlled vocabularies.   
(1 page max., single-spaced) 

#### 3. Data Dictionary
_Draft due: 4/1_

#### 4. Metadata Creation Guidelines/Process  
_Draft due: 4/8_  
Describe in detail how your metadata will be created. For example, if your metadata will be 'handcrafted,' describe the process, tools, file formats, etc. your metadata creators will use. Include any input guidelines your metadata creators will need to complete this task. If you are repurposing existing metadata, describe the processes and tools you will use to harvest, collect, modify, and/or enhance your data. Cite any tools or scripts or, if writing your own, point to online documentation or include them in an Appendix of your final document. (If you do write your own tools or scripts, consider sharing them! [https://github.com](github.com) is a great place for this.)

#### 5. Quality Control Plan  
_Draft due: 4/22_  
Assess the importance of each of Bruce and Hillman's seven characteristics of quality to the purposes your metadata will support. For each characteristic, define the level of quality you will require in your metadata creation. What measures will you take to ensure compliance with each of your defined quality levels? Outline your plan for implementing these quality control measures.


#### 6. Metadata Use Policy
_Due with final draft._  
In your final document, include a policy statement outlining how others may re-use your data. You may wish to apply one of the licenses we'll talk about in class.

#### 7. Examples
_Draft due: 4/15_  
Provide examples of metadata for 2 resources. For the draft, send digital files in your metadata's data format. For the final draft, include human-readable examples within the text of your document. 

#### 8. Crosswalks
_Draft due: 4/29_  
You will submit two crosswalks with your project:
1. Choose a classmate's schema to crosswalk your metadata to, or work with a classmate to design a common schema that you will both crosswalk to. Include notes for each data element, where necessary, to explain what steps you would take for normalizing your data values to fit your classmate's guidelines. Also note where you are missing mandatory data elements and what steps you would take to provide them. 
2. Crosswalk your metadata to Qualified Dublin Core for the purposes of class aggregation.  

Use any format you like for your crosswalks, but final drafts should be human-readable and easily printed (i.e., included within the text of your final document).

#### 9. Metadata
_Due 5/6 for Aggregation Party_  
Digital files for 20 of your resources described in Qualified Dublin Core (using your crosswalk)

_Due with final draft_  
Digital file(s) for at least 20 resources described by your guidelines.
