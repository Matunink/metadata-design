### Grading Policies

#### Class Participation (45%)
A major component of this class will involve weekly class discussion of assigned readings. You should come prepared each week to contribute to a group exploration of issues raised in the readings. All students are expected to engage in courteous and respectful interaction with fellow class participants.

Throughout the course, we will collaborate on building a wiki-based list of metadata-related resources. You should plan to contribute at least one resource per week and to actively participate in the list organization.

#### Standards Case Study (5%)
(See Standards Case Study Assignment)

#### Course Project (40%)
Over the course of the semester, you will design and implement a descriptive metadata project for a collection of resources. (See Course Project.) First drafts of each section of the documentation will be turned in for review throughout the semester. The final documentation and 20 sample metadata records will be due at the class final.

#### Final Essay (10%)
Due with the final draft of your course project, your final essay will summarize lessons learned during the design of your course project, supported by class and external readings.
