#### Standards Case Study Assignment  
Due 2/25
(20 points)

You will choose one of the standards from Jenn Riley's 'Seeing standards: A visualization of the metadata universe' ([http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/~jenlrile/metadatamap/](http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/~jenlrile/metadatamap/)) and research its scope, purpose, audience, and development (2 pages max., single-spaced). The standard's website, specification, and associated listservs are all good places to look to answer the following questions:
- What kind of standard is this? What is its purpose? What is the range of metadata it is intended to encompass? What is the makeup of the community that uses it?
- How old is this standard? How many revisions has it been through? Give a brief history of the standard.
- Who maintains the standard? How is the standard reviewed and revised to accomodate user needs? Who is involved in this process? How is input solicited and gathered from the community?
- Describe one surprising or unexpected thing you discovered about the standard or the community during this exercise.

Please address all questions and cite sources for your answers. If you could not find an answer to a question, please list where you looked.
